## About myself

- ðŸ˜‹ In most cases, I tend to develop things that I personally desire. I don't enjoy following the crowd.
- ðŸ’– I'm from China, and my English is not good. If possible, please communicate with me in Chinese (I am learning English, but progress is slow).
- ðŸŽ® I personally enjoy small and beautiful pixel games, such as Minecraft and Stardew Valley. I also really like puzzle-solving mystery games, like Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective.
- ðŸ’» I am currently self-learning Java, so most of my public repositories are written in Java. However, I also know C++, but only for game development purposes.
- ðŸŒˆ  I hope that people all over the world can live together harmoniously.

**My coding skills are very poor. If my terrible code gives you a headache, I apologize for that. Can you tell me how to improve? I would greatly appreciate your help:)**
