## About Myself

*   ðŸ˜‹ I tend to develop things **that I personally want or need**. I don't enjoy **just** following the crowd.
*   ðŸ’– I'm from China, and my English **isn't very fluent**. If possible, please communicate with me in Chinese (I am learning English, but **making progress slowly**).
*   ðŸŽ® I **particularly enjoy** small but beautiful pixel art games, such as Minecraft and Stardew Valley. I also **really like** puzzle-solving mystery games, like *Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective*.
*   ðŸ’» I am currently **self-learning** Java, so most of my public repositories are in Java. However, I also know C++, **though** only for game development purposes.
*   ðŸŒˆ I hope that people all over the world can live together **harmoniously in peace**.

**My coding skills are still developing / I'm still learning to code well. If my **poorly written** code **confuses you** / **is confusing**, I apologize for that. Could you advise me on how to improve? I would greatly appreciate your help :)**
