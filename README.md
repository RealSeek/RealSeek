## About myself

- ðŸ˜‹ I love developing interesting things, but my coding skills are bad
- ðŸ’– I'm from China and my english is terrible, but I'll try to use machine translation for conversations in other languages, so if there's something wrong with my grammar, I'm really sorry
- ðŸŽ® I like to play pixel style games, such as: Minecraft, Stardew Valley and so on
- ðŸ’» I'm teaching myself Java, so most of my projects will be Java based. I have learned C++ for a while, but only for the game development part
- ðŸŒˆ I hope programmers all over the world can get along with each other
